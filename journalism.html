			<h2>📰 Student Journalism</h2>
			<p>
			  During my time at Carmel High School, I had the opportunity to serve as 
			  <a href="https://carmelacumen.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Acumen</strong></a> Editor-in-Chief, 
			  working under the award-winning <a href="https://hilite.org/" target="_blank"><strong>HiLite</strong></a> newsmagazine. 
			  It was a space where I learned, led, and collaborated with an incredibly talented team.

				<p style="margin: 0;">Some of the roles I held formally:</p>
				<ul style="list-style: disc inside; margin: 0.5rem 0 0;">
				  <li><em>Editor-in-Chief</em> – Acumen</li>
				  <li><em>Secretary</em> – Quill & Scroll Honor Society</li>
				</ul>

			  <div style="border-left: 5px solid #452d41; padding-left: 1rem; background: #f0e6ec; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
				<p style="margin: 0;">And a few things teammates often knew me for:</p>
				<ul style="list-style: disc inside; margin: 0.5rem 0 0;">
				  <li><em>Graphic designer</em> – always ready with layout ideas and visual polish</li>
				  <li><em>Visual storyteller</em> – focused on clarity, creativity, and impact</li>
				</ul>
			  </div>
			</div>
		  
			<p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
			  I’ve grown a lot through these experiences — not just as a leader, but as a collaborator and teammate.
			  Feel free to explore more of my work below!

					  <h2>Standards</h2>
					  
					  <p>Standard 1: Journalistic Perspectives</p>
					  <h3>Students understand the history, development and function of a free and independent press in the United States.</h3>
					  <h4>Throughout my Mass Media: Visual Journalism class, I learned a lot about the history of journalism and free speech. As HiLite staff members, we are lucky to have a lot more flexibility and free speech when it comes to publishing, and this enables us to express our ideas and concerns in columns as well as discuss issues that we truly care about.​</h4>
					  
					  <p>Standard 2: Legal and Ethical Principles</p>
					  <h3>Students understand and apply knowledge of legal and ethical principles related to the functioning of scholastic journalism in the United States.</h3>
					  <h4>I apply knowledge of the legal and ethical principles behind media coverage throughout my work, whether I am creating graphics, taking photos, or writing stories. For example, in my graphics, I strive to obtain information from credible sources and ensure that I do not violate copyright laws. In taking photos, I always make sure to ask for permission beforehand, especially if it is in an area where there might be a reasonable expectation of privacy.</h4>

					  <p>Standards 3 and 4: Media Writing Processes / Writing for Media</p>
					  <h3>Students discuss ideas for writing with others. They write coherent and focused stories that demonstrate well-researched information, appropriate journalistic structure and style, and a tightly reasoned flow of ideas. Students progress through stages of journalistic writing processes.</h3>
					  <h4>While I focus on graphic design and have the most experience with it, I have also challenged myself by trying out photo and writing assignments. Some of my best photos can be seen in my portfolio. As a member of Quill & Scroll, I have also written several MUSE reviews, analyzing <a href="https://hilite.org/81222/blogs/muse/review-2-in-1-laptops-a-developing-technology-muse/">2-in-1 laptops</a> and films like <a href="https://hilite.org/82725/blogs/review-%e5%bc%80%e7%ab%af-or-reset-in-english-overcomes-an-unsatisfying-ending-with-complex-characters-intriguing-plot-muse/">Reset</a> (a TV show) and <a href="https://hilite.org/86002/blogs/review-creation-of-the-gods-i-is-a-celebration-of-chinese-mythology-muse/">Creation of the Gods I</a> (a movie). The first story I wrote—in collaboration with a fellow staff member—can be found <a href="https://hilite.org/78956/news/keeping-up-with-carmel-disappearing-classes/">here</a>.</h4>
					
					  <p>Standard 5: Newspaper Production Cycles</p>
					  <h3>Students write within an established production cycle, meeting deadlines and following Associated Press style manual guidelines for consistency. Students analyze, evaluate and critique their own work and that of others as they improve future publications or media based on feedback.</h3>
					  <h4>I understand the responsibility that comes with both being a staff member and an Editor-in-Chief and the importance of doing my part so that other staff members are able to do theirs and the process runs smoothly. As an Editor-in-Chief, the production cycle for me includes collaborating with the Acumen leadership team (composed of one other Editor-in-Chief and an Associate Editor) to plan out the issue cycle, developing and selecting interesting yet relevant topics, hosting maestros, designing spreads and adding supplementary pieces of information or graphics, proofreading to ensure spreads are ready to be published, and, finally, promoting the published issue. Throughout the entire cycle, I communicate with content gatherers and help others succeed in their roles. Every production cycle, I complete my responsibilities before given deadlines to ensure other staff members have adequate time to complete their own responsibilities. In graphics, spread design, and other assignments, I follow the HiLite style manual guidelines to ensure consistency with others.</h4>

					  <p>Standard 6: Media Convergence</p>
					  <h3>Students write and develop multimedia formats that mix audio, video and data.</h3>
					  <h4>As a graphic designer, I often create visualizations, such as line graphs or pie charts, based on data that I gather from credible sources, in order to present complicated data in a more comprehensible and eye-catching way. Over my years on the HiLite staff, I have created a variety of graphics, as shown in my portfolio. I always strive to make my graphics informative instead of decorative, and I believe my skills have improved throughout the years. As we transitioned online during my time on staff, I have also taken the opportunity to incorporate interactive and multimedia elements.</h4>

					  <p>Standard 7: Media Leadership</p>
					  <h3>Students understand the organization, economics and management of media staffs</h3>
					  <h4>Through my time as an Acumen Editor-in-Chief, I have learned more about what a management position on media staffs entails by experiencing it firsthand and observing other members of management. I have not only demonstrated leadership through my responsibilities in each issue cycle, but also through my daily actions on the staff. I have dedicated plenty of time outside of class to improve the staff, such as by attending events to encourage more people to join the staff and by often going above and beyond my regular responsibilities.</h4>
